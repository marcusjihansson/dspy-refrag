Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which involves crafting specific, often brittle prompts, DSPy introduces high-level abstractions such as signatures, modules, and teleprompters. Signatures specify input/output behaviors declaratively, modules allow for flexible composition of tasks into pipelines, and teleprompters optimize prompts to improve performance.\n\nThe main goal of DSPy is to replace manual prompt construction with code-based, structured programs that are easier to develop, maintain, and scale across different tasks, models, and domains. It emphasizes a programmatic style similar to traditional machine learning frameworks, enabling developers to think of prompt interactions as part of a larger pipeline rather than ad hoc strings. Overall, DSPy aims to make working with LLMs more predictable, efficient, and less fragile than conventional prompt engineering techniques.",
