It achieves this through three core components:\n\n1.  **Signatures:** Users define the input/output behavior of a task declaratively, rather than writing a specific prompt. For example, instead of crafting a detailed prompt, a user can simply declare `question -> answer`. DSPy then internally converts this signature into a full prompt for the underlying LLM.\n\n2.  **Modules:** These are building blocks that use signatures to interact with the LLM. The core module, `dspy.Predict`, takes a signature, constructs the prompt, sends it to the LLM, and handles the response. These modules can be composed to create complex pipelines that automate well-known prompting techniques like chain of thought or RAG.\n\n3.  **Teleprompters (Optimizers):** This component refines the integration. Teleprompters \"compile\" the entire program (a pipeline of modules and signatures) to iteratively generate and optimize the prompts. This process tunes the prompts to maximize a performance metric, making the LLM interaction more effective and robust, similar to how an ML model's weights are optimized.\n\nIn essence, the integration flow is:\n*   A user defines a task using a declarative **Signature**.\n*   This signature is used within a **Module**.\n*   DSPy translates the signature into a **prompt** and sends it to the **LLM**.\n*   **Teleprompters** can be used to automatically optimize these prompts for better results, creating a systematic and modular pipeline.",
