Here's how:\n\n## Three Core Abstractions:\n\n1. **Signatures** - Act as declarative specifications that abstract away manual prompting. They define what transformation should happen (e.g., \"question -> answer\") rather than how to prompt the LLM. DSPy internally converts these signatures into prompts for the underlying LLM.\n\n2. **Modules** - Replace hand-crafted prompting techniques and can be composed into pipelines. The core `dspy.Predict` module stores Signatures and constructs prompts internally. Built-in modules translate to common prompting techniques like chain of thought, ReAct, RAG, and program of thought.\n\n3. **Teleprompters (Optimizers)** - Compile and optimize all modules in the pipeline to maximize a metric, iteratively generating optimized LLM prompts.\n\n## Key Integration Approach:\n\n- Instead of hard-coded \"prompt templates,\" DSPy provides a **declarative, programmatic interface** similar to PyTorch\n- Developers define tasks using shorthand notation (e.g., `dspy.Signature(\"question -> answer\")`) or class-based signatures\n- DSPy automatically handles prompt construction, structured formatting, and parsing logic\n- The framework manages the translation between high-level signatures and actual LLM prompts behind the scenes\n\nThis approach aims to make LLM integration more modular, composable, and systematic compared to traditional prompt engineering.",
