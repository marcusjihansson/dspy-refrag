The core of this integration lies in three high-level abstractions:\n\n*   **Signatures:** These are declarative specifications that abstract and dictate the input/output behavior of a module. Instead of writing detailed prompts, you define what a text transformation should achieve using natural language. Signatures can be defined using shorthand string notation (e.g., `\"question -> answer\"`) or as Python classes, offering more control over input/output fields and task descriptions. DSPy then internally converts these signatures into prompts for the underlying LLM.\n*   **Modules:** These components replace existing hand-prompting techniques and can be composed to form arbitrary pipelines. The `dspy.Predict` module is central to this, as all other modules, including Signatures, invoke `Predict` through their `forward()` function call. `Predict` stores the Signature and uses it to construct a prompt for the LLM.\n*   **Teleprompters (Optimizers):** These components, through a compilation process, optimize all modules within a pipeline to maximize a specified metric. This is analogous to how machine learning models are optimized using learning optimizers in frameworks like PyTorch.\n\nEssentially, DSPy aims to translate the artful and tedious process of prompt construction into a more systematic, modular, and composable programming model, allowing developers to build complex LLM-powered applications in a way that feels more like traditional software development.",
